Sample Framework built for supervised learning methods 
used in gt-cs7641.

This was done to compare the java based weka package with
the python based scikit-learn.  

The goal is to see if the implementation of algorithms
arrives at the same answer.

R is used to generate graphs of the images.

This basic framework can be used for your project work
giving an example based on the Iris data set that runs 
the algorithms, generates graphs, creates document template 
and pdf generation.

Weka v3.6.11 was used.
